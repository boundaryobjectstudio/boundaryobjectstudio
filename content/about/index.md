We are a studio of independent researchers, builders, and activists who seek
to share and build upon our individual projects towards a common aim of building
a future with AI that can benefit more people and communities around the world.

We seek to incubate ideas, initiatives and communities across borders and
boundaries, particularly those that enable new **boundary objects** to emerge.

We operate as a distributed collective, connecting our individual ideas and
discoveries in a common space towards our common mission.

To learn more about our work or to collaborate with the studio,
